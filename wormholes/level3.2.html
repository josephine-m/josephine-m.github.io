            You were unsuccessful at punching the shark and luckily it only gives you a small bite and you make it back to shore. As you walk up the sand you see a <a href="https://oceana.org/marine-life/corals-and-other-invertebrates/bluebottle">small blue jellyfish</a> had washed up too. What should you do?
