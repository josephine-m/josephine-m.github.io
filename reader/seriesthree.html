       <div class="bodytext">
        I feel like I’ve always made my discoveries in the in between 
        and I’ve always talked about my work as being in between the 
        cracks of art forms. What I find there is usually a new form. 
       </div>


        
       <div class="bodytext">
        I love to also work with my voice in what I would call in between 
        emotions—it’s the feelings that we don’t have words for, that we 
        haven’t delineated into a label. That’s a very creative part of 
        life, for me, in between the cracks of everything. 
       </div>
        
        
      <div class="bodytext">
        We’ve always lived in the unknown. It’s just that it hasn’t 
        been front and center the way that it is now. Now we’re more 
        aware of that. So in a sense, it’s a time that we can really 
        grow and learn from, because that’s the way it’s always been and 
        always will be.
      </div>


           <div class="bodytext">
            Do you make space for joy and happiness alongside grief and 
            pain within the bubble of the space that you’re physically or 
            emotionally in? Can you, as an artist, build on these coexisting 
            emotions to energetically move forward?
           </div>


           <div class="bodytext">
            I’ve always believed that the palette of emotion can be within one 
            piece. Certainly the way pleasure and pain come and go is part of 
            life. That’s part of our destiny as human beings. We usually grasp 
            pleasure and push away pain, but that actually makes for 
            suffering. 
           </div>
            
            <div class="bodytext">
                I’ve always been incredibly grateful for the life I’ve been given, 
            but somehow in this challenging world, I’m feeling my creativity 
            blossoming. It feels like it’s right there—the river of creativity, 
            because it comes out of love. That has been getting me from one day 
            to the next. And it’s very joyous. 
            </div>
            
            <div class="bodytext">
                I was talking to one of my colleagues and she said, 
            “I feel guilty that we’re having such a wonderful time 
            making music.” And I said, “No. Even within grief is joy.”
            What we’re all trying for is to get to a raw-heartedness, 
            which is that all of your defenses melt away. 
            And that comes down to a certain kind of existential sorrow.
            </div> 

            <div class="bodytext">
                And so for me, instead of thinking that that’s something 
                I don’t want to feel, when I feel that, I’m connected. 
                Joy also comes from that because ultimately, it’s a sense 
                of compassion and a very deep acknowledgement of sorrow. 
            </div>
            
        
            
            <div class="bodytext">
                Another thing I’ve learned over the years is resilience. 
            I just take it step by step and find creative solutions to 
            limitations.
            </div>



<div class="bodytext">
    If you’re doing something that you love, 
and it can be any kind of creativity—being an artist, 
a composer, making a wonderful meal, learning a 
language—giving something to someone else is so pleasurable. 
That is what we need to really embody and connect to. 
The joy and the love of doing. I think that helps so much.
</div>

<div class="italictext">
    Are there things that guide you forward when the picture becomes murky?
</div>

<div class="bodytext">
    The Buddhist teachings that I’ve been engaged with for so many 
years—Chögyam Trungpa Rinpoche and Pema Chödrön’s teachings, 
have really gotten me through. Every time I go back to those, 
it’s as if I’m reading them for the first time. They seem to apply. 
We’ve been training for death, and we’ve been training for disaster, 
and we’ve been training for things not going our way, for years. 
</div>

<div class="bodytext">
    So yes, it’s still hard, and it really hurts but I think that there’s a 
kind of perspective you get when it’s not so surprising. 
</div>


<div class="bodytext">
    There can be a very dark period… It’s like in a forest, 
when the leaves fall and decay. Out of that decay the new life comes.
</div>

<div class="bodytext">
    The multiplication of adversity can lead to an 
amplification of change. We’re honing our skill sets and 
learning to operate in new ways based on new constraints. 
Is there a benefit to working in modular forms, where each 
piece can be its own world that builds into a greater whole?
</div>

<div class="bodytext">
    With some of my early site-specific 
work I was definitely thinking in terms of 
modular forms. What I would do is create these 
modules of material, and adapt them to different 
performing spaces. We’re talking about the late ’60s, 
early ’70s. I was thinking in terms of units, and those 
units would be reconfigured, depending on the performing architecture 
or where we were going.
</div>

<div class="bodytext">
    So now, I’ve been working on a piece for about the last 10 years, 
called Indra’s Net and it has to do with principles of interdependence. 
Indra’s Net is an ancient Hindu/Buddhist legend and teaching story. 
There was an enlightened king, Indra, who created a net that covered 
the universe and at each intersection of the net was an infinitely-faceted 
jewel that reflected the infinite facets of all the other jewels of the universe.
</div> 


<div class="bodytext">
    And each jewel was slightly different. 
One example of this idea, in musical form is a hocket—a fully 
interdependent form. If one person falls down, then both people fall. 
And I’ve always had that principle in my music, the passing of something, 
or the leaning of something on another something, makes for a third something.
</div>

<div class="bodytext">
    I remember before this pandemic, 
talking to one of the people in my 
ensemble, Ellen Fisher, and I said, 
“You know, Indra’s net is a very inspiring concept because 
it means that everything that each of us does influences 
everything else in the universe. And so, be aware of our actions, 
they have resonance. But wouldn’t it be interesting to also have a 
very dark section of the piece, as in a disease? A disease also 
is interdependent—how it passes, how it spreads. The same way that our 
actions do. Wow! One morning I woke up and thought, hats off to this virus. 
</div>

<div class="bodytext">
    I mean, one brilliant organism. It’s adaptable, it moves quickly. 
The virus is a manifestation of the power of nature and from my viewpoint, 
it’s essential to be respectful of all life forms. Here is this tiny organism 
that’s wreaking destruction and havoc on our world but when we acknowledge 
its complexity and potency, we are in dialog with it, and can ask for its mercy. 
That’s what art was about in ancient times, and that’s one aspect of what art 
is about in many indigenous cultures.
</div>

<div class="bodytext">
    I would say Indra’s Net is 
probably the most spatially 
dependent piece that I’ve ever made. 
I see how the sound in space works. 
Everything is related to space. 
It will be a performance and an installation 
where the audience could walk through and listen 
very closely but they would hear the whole thing at the same time. 
</div>

<div class="bodytext">
    You know, this idea of tactility and then different distances. 
I believe in the magic of the piece, and the beautiful group of 
singers that I have, they are just remarkable. So my goal has been 
to keep this process going somehow.
</div>

<div class="bodytext">
    Recently I read an interview by a composer 
whom I love and he was talking about the way he works, 
that he writes down his compositions, and it doesn’t actually 
matter who performs them except that they have to be really good 
musicians, to do what he wants, which is what he has on the page. 
It doesn’t matter who the people are. And I was thinking, wow, 
I work very differently. I mostly make my pieces thinking of 
particular people and voices. Even in very challenging situations, 
like an orchestra or a big chorus where I don’t know everybody, 
I go and work with them and then I might adapt my material to who they are.
</div> 

<div class="bodytext">
    There’s always the give-and-take between the music as a fluid and responsive form, 
to the humans—because it’s not paint, it’s humans. I certainly respect the other way, 
but I was almost laughing, because I was thinking, 
“I work exactly in the opposite way.” You know, 
I’m always thinking about who will perform it. 
And it makes a big difference for me.
</div>

<div class="bodytext">
    The music composition is really precise. 
I work for years before I even go into rehearsal. 
And there is a right and a wrong in relation to the 
form but within it, there are places to play, particularly 
for people that have been working with me for a while and know 
the parameters. 
</div>

<div class="bodytext">
    It’s got that kind of fluidity but at the same time a
 very meticulous and precise form, because I love structure. 
 I feel like an architect, I love to make my building. 
 And yet at the same time, I like to have softness in it too, 
 like if you think of a Frank Gehry building. His buildings breathe 
 and are so beautiful. I always see them next to some of the other 
 buildings in New York. They’re always organic. So that’s the way that 
 I think of it. I don’t really like to make improvisational forms, particularly. 
</div>

<div class="italictext">
    I really like to make a form. To make a beautiful organic 
    form takes architecture and engineering.
</div>


<div class="bodytext">
    Well, I’m in the country now, 
three-and-a-half hours outside of New York City and 
what brings me instant joy is to just walk outside and 
breathe the air. And to see the leaves turning now. It’s just 
magnificent. So for me, having glimpses of nature and her processes 
is what gives me instant joy. And then as a little 
adjunct to that, more awareness of how much we have to fight 
to keep our beautiful work going. Protect that.
</div>

<div class="bodytext">
    I remember being in my loft in Lower Manhattan during 
lockdown and New York City is really noisy. The noise 
bombardment is relentless. But it was very quiet and 
I could hear birds singing. And I realized I’ve never been in 
New York when it’s quiet enough that I could actually hear 
birds singing. One day, I finally decided to take a walk, you know, 
</div>

<div class="italictext">
    risk it. 
</div>

<div class="bodytext">
    And I walked to the river. I found a little tree, 
and up in the tree was a mockingbird that was doing a 
whole repertoire of 50 different tunes. And I just stood 
there for maybe an hour. Nature is so precious. That bird 
meant so much to me. There’s so much out there 
that we’re missing because we’re so caught up in our own minds. 
</div>


<div class="bodytext">
    And I think that’s a lesson for us all, that we can appreciate the 
smallest thing, and just know that we’re so blessed. 
</div>
