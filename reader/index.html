      Human beings are social animals. We spend large portions of our waking hours communicating with others, and the possibilities for conversation are seemingly endless—we can make plans and crack jokes; reminisce about the past and dream about the future; share ideas and spread information. This ability to communicate—with almost anyone, about almost anything—has played a central role in our species’ ability to not just survive, but flourish.
      I’ve always believed that the palette of emotion can be within one piece. Certainly the way pleasure and pain come and go is part of life. That’s part of our destiny as human beings. We usually grasp pleasure and push away pain, but that actually makes for suffering. I’ve always been incredibly grateful for the life I’ve been given, but somehow in this challenging world, I’m feeling my creativity blossoming. It feels like it’s right there—the river of creativity, because it comes out of love. That has been getting me from one day to the next. And it’s very joyous. I was talking to one of my colleagues and she said, “I feel guilty that we’re having such a wonderful time making music.” And I said, “No. Even within grief is joy.”
      With some of my early site-specific work I was definitely thinking in terms of modular forms. What I would do is create these modules of material, and adapt them to different performing spaces. We’re talking about the late ’60s, early ’70s. I was thinking in terms of units, and those units would be reconfigured, depending on the performing architecture or where we were going.
      In order to distinguish between these two possibilities, the researchers conducted a follow-up experiment. In this experiment, participants were asked to bring a friend or relative of their choosing to the lab with them; these companions were asked to wait in an adjoining room while participants answered questions in a fMRI machine. As in the first study, participants responded to questions about either their own opinions and attitudes or the opinions and attitudes of someone else; unlike in the first study, these participants were explicitly told whether their responses would be “shared” or “private”; shared responses were relayed in real time to each participant’s companion and private responses were never seen by anyone.
