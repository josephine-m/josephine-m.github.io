                Before moving on to the benefits of social connection and why you need to have this in your life, let’s define it first. When talking about social connection, we mean the feeling of closeness or belonging, 
                either to other individuals or to a group of people. While many studies have been conducted about this subject, one particular study has provided strong scientific evidence that social connection is one of 
                our core psychological needs.

            <div class="boxtextone">
                This means that it plays an important role in how satisfied we feel with our lives.
            </div>

            <div class="bodytext">
                There’s no doubt about it – we human beings are profoundly social. We have a powerful drive to connect with other people and this drive is deeply embedded in history. 
                The moment we are born, we already yearn to build a relationship with the person who cares most about us. As we grow up, the effects of this first relationship we have will reverberate all 
                throughout our lives.

            <div class="bodytext">
                When children are loved and well taken care of from the beginning, there is a very high likelihood that they would have strong social connections as they grow older. Think about your relationships right now… 
            </div>

            <div class="boxtextone">
                Are they secure? Are you happy with them? Do they enrich your life? Or do you feel like there is something 
                lacking in your social life?
            </div>


            <div class="bodytext">
                While having plenty of social connections is a good thing, it’s also wise to focus on the quality of these connections. 
                The strongest social connections are the ones you share with people who are concerned about your happiness and well-being. 
                They should provide you with hope and inspiration instead of making you feel stressed or burdened out. In this modern-day and age, too many of us are focused on online social interactions. While there is nothing wrong with these connections, personal or face-to-face connections are much more meaningful and beneficial. 
                You can easily determine if your social connections are meaningful as they would provide you with:

                <div class="define"><a href="https://www.thefreedictionary.com/appraisal">Appraisal</a></div>
            </div>

            <div class="boxtexttwo">
                This means that the people you share connections with feel comfortable enough to give you honest feedback and constructive criticism. This is a type of support that you can’t expect from people you don’t know that well. Only those whom you trust and who trust you in return would have the courage to provide you with genuine appraisal.

            <div class="boxtextone">
                Your connections can provide you with companionship to make you feel more socially accepted. You would feel this when you belong to a certain group like a church group, a book club, or any other kind of group where you share commonalities and you get together frequently to interact socially.

            </div>

            <div class="boxtexttwo">
                This type of support assures you that you aren’t alone. This is another important thing that you get from connecting socially with other people. Such people would nurture you and motivate you to keep moving forward no matter how hard life gets. You can get this from relationships where you share love, care, intimacy, encouragement, and trust.

            </div>

            <div class="boxtextone">
                This type of support comes from favors, resources, and other tangible things that you get from the people you are connected with. This is very important too, especially when you find yourself in a tight spot and you need someone to bail you out.

            </div>

            <div class="bodytext">
                Obviously, you cannot get all of these from a single person. This is why you need to establish connections with different kinds of people. You know that the connections you make are worth keeping when you appreciate and value them.

When you are lonely, you are more vulnerable to anxiety, depression, and a wide range of illnesses.

And one of the great things about social connections is that you don’t have to be physically present to benefit from them.
